Blockchain-Based Supply-Chain Management System

The Blockchain-Based Stationery Supply Chain Management System utilizes Hyperledger Fabric for establishing a secure and efficient blockchain network. This framework ensures data integrity and immutability. Complementing this, the system incorporates ReactJS for its front-end interface, providing a user-friendly experience. Through this integration, stakeholders benefit from enhanced transparency, security, and real-time tracking capabilities in the stationery supply chain.
